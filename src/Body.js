          Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, who earned the moniker 'India's
          nightingale' for her soulful voice, left for her heavenly abode on
          February 6. The singer had been admitted to Mumbai's Breach Candy
          hospital on January 8 after being diagnosed with Covid-19 and
          pneumonia. Although she recovered from Covid, she was put on
          ventilator support after her condition deteriorated on Saturday. In
          her illustrious career spanning over seven decades, Mangeshkar
          recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and sung songs in over
          thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages. She was
          awarded the Bharat Ratna and was also the recipient of three National
          Film Awards, among many other honours she received during the span of
          her career. From sports persons and politicians to artists and
          businesspeople, the nation mourned in unison on February 6. The mortal
          remains of the legendary singer were draped in tricolor as they were
          taken from Peddar Road to Shivaji Park, where she was cremated with
          full state honours. While many Indians wrote their condolence messages
          on social media and paid tributes with heartfelt videos and creations,
          people from around the world too grieved the demise of the Queen of
          Melody. Many international singers and celebrities tweeted about her
          demise. Lata Mangeshkar is no more but for billions of people who
          heard her sing she is alive and will live on through her voice and her
          love for her country. For me the most haunting song of hers was Mere
          Watan ke logo. It is a tribute to the armed forces who have died
          protecting our country. I had heard this song many times but the one
          time I could not stop crying was when I attended a memorial for Widows
          Welfare Association of which Mohini Giri, has been the guiding light
          and the backbone of young wives and their children , whose husbands
          were killed in action or fighting against terrorists to keep India
          safe. The time I heard it with the widows who Mohini Giri had helped
          was the time when the words got etched in my mind and when I truly
          cried along with the widows around me and felt their pain and what the
          everyone of us should remember in the Lyrics. Not many people know it.
